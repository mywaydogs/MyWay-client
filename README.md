# MyWay 

MyWay (name was inspired by the author's dog - "Maui") is a SaaS project intended to help dog trainers keep track of their clients' progress in training their dogs. It acts as a CMS (Customer Management System) that allows to record the customers' details along with tools that will help them plan a workplan for dog trainings, and to share it with their customers in an organized manner.

Currently, this is what a dog's profile page looks like:

![Dog profile page](doc/assets/dog-profile-page.png)

In this page a dog trainer can list the goals agreed upon with the customer, and for each such goal, provide tasks with their scheudle.

Then, the trainer can easily see in the chart the progress it has made so far, and edit the schedule accordingly.

Later, the dog trainer will be able to also document behavioral attributes of the dog, accessories used for each training session, and maybe even send him a digital invoice using a third party service.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
